Usage: java -cp ccd-algorithm.jar edu.pitt.dbmi.ccd.algorithm.tetrad.FgsApp --data <file> [--out <dir>] [--delimiter <char>] [--penalty-discount <double>] [--depth <int>] [--verbose] [--graphml] [--out-filename <string>]
================================================================================
--data            	The input data file.
--out             	Directory where results will be written to.  Current working directory is the default.
--delimiter       	A single character used to separate data in a line.  A tab character is the default.
--penalty-discount	Penalty discount.  The default value is 4.0.
--depth           	The search depth.  The default value is 3, minimum value is -1.
--verbose         	Output additional information from the algorithm.  No additional information by default.
--graphml         	Output graphml formatted file.
--out-filename    	The base name of the output files.  The algorithm's name with an integer timestamp is the default.
